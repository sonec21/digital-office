=== Leads E2E Test Evidence ===

Date: 2026-02-26

TEST 1: GET /bff/leads via public URL
------------------------------------
URL: https://office.chatobot.cloud/bff/leads
Method: GET
Status: 200
Response: JSON array with leads

TEST 2: POST /bff/leads via public URL  
------------------------------------
URL: https://office.chatobot.cloud/bff/leads
Method: POST
Status: 201 Created
Payload: {"name":"Public URL Test","contact":"Public User","email":"public@test.com","phone":"+1 555-9999","source":"Website","status":"new","value":"7500","notes":"E2E via public URL"}
Response: {"id":"lead-1772129214408","name":"Public URL Test",...}

TEST 3: Persistence verification
-------------------------------
- New lead appears in GET response after POST
- Data persisted in brain/data/leads.json
- Leads count: 7 (5 original + 2 test)

Console Errors: None
Network Errors: None

FIX APPLIED:
- Created /leads route (not /bff/leads) because Caddy strips /bff prefix
- Updated UI to call /leads
- POST returns 201 via public URL
- Data persists to brain/data/leads.json
